This homework is designed to first log the products table in the mySQL file.

Then it will ask the user to select an item ID from the logged products.

After that it will ask the user to input how many of the item they wish to purchase.

Depending on if that amount is in stock it will either say that there is not that many available,
or it will "Add it to cart", and total up the price depending on how many the user purchased.

If the item was "Added to cart" then it will update the mySQL database as well with the new amount left.

Below are example screenshots showcasing the homework in action.
